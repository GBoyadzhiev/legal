# About *Magic Coloring Adventure*

Hi, I’m an indie developer who created **Magic Coloring Adventure** with a lot of care and passion.  
My goal is to give children a safe, fun, and creative way to enjoy coloring on iPhone and iPad.  

The books are filled with bold outlines, simple shapes, and cheerful characters — perfect for little hands and big imaginations.  
There’s zero tracking and zero advertising here, just a cozy coloring space for your family.
