Hi, I’m an indie developer who created **Magic Colouring** with a lot of care and passion.  
My goal is to give children a safe, fun, and creative way to enjoy colouring on iPhone and iPad.  

The books are filled with bold outlines, simple shapes, and cheerful characters — perfect for little hands and big imaginations.  
There’s zero tracking and zero advertising here, just a cozy colouring space for your family.

Some of the artwork in this app was created with the help of AI tools.  
Every image has been reviewed and refined by me to make sure it’s appropriate, safe, and enjoyable for children.
